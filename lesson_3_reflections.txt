When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When sharing with others for collaboration or so I can work on the same project from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
there may be conflicts between what you are currently working on and the state of the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
clone makes a copy of a repository. Fork makes a copy but retains the connection back to the original. 
you can't make changes to the origianl repository, but can make commits to the fork in your own repository. it's easier than cloning someones 
repository and retains the info that it was someones elses work originally. branches are work on a project that you do not want to (yet) commit to the master branch. Like a new feature you are tring to add but us not ready yet or a bug you are trying to fix.
